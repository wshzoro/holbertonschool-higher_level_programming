==============================
Test for module 7-base_geometry
==============================

Class import:
-------------
>>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry

Instantiation tests:
-------------------
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> type(bg)
<class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

Tests for the area() method:
----------------------------
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> try:
...     bg.area()
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
area() is not implemented

Tests for the integer_validator() method:
-----------------------------------------

# Test with a valid integer
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> bg.integer_validator("my_int", 12)

# Test with several valid integers
>>> bg.integer_validator("width", 89)
>>> bg.integer_validator("height", 100)

# Test with zero value (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("age", 0)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
age must be greater than 0

# Test with a negative value (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("distance", -4)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
distance must be greater than 0

# Test with a string (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("name", "John")
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
name must be an integer

# Test with None (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("value", None)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
value must be an integer

# Test with a boolean (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("valid", True)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
valid must be an integer

# Test with a list (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("values", [1, 2, 3])
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
values must be an integer

# Test with a tuple (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("position", (1, 2))
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
position must be an integer

# Test with a dictionary (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("user", {"id": 1, "name": "John"})
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
user must be an integer

# Test with a set (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("numbers", {1, 2, 3})
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
numbers must be an integer

# Test with a float (should raise an exception)
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("average", 7.8)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
average must be an integer

# Test with two missing arguments
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator()
... except Exception as e:
...     print("Exception raised")
Exception raised

# Test with one missing argument
>>> try:
...     bg.integer_validator("age")
... except Exception as e:
...     print("Exception raised")
Exception raised
